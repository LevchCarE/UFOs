## Summary: 
One disadvantage regarding the website is that there is not enough explanation on how the country and state are abbreviated, thus the user might find problems when filtering the Data.
It is recommended for future development, to include how the content is abbreviated as well as additional information with more dates and countries, due to the 
fact that in this case the information is only in the us, so it does not make sense to create a country filter.
